# pyfar files

Stores files that are loaded by other pyfar packages. Files are organized in folders according to the package and module name.

## Adding files

- Files are stored using the [git large file system](https://git-lfs.com/). Before adding new files, their extension must be added to . gitattributes.
- Each file stored must contain a license, e.g., `rir.wav` requires `rir_license.txt`
